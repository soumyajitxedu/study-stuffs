## 1. Introduction to Generative AI and Diffusion Models

### 1.1 The Evolution of Generative Models
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative field within computer vision and artificial intelligence, demonstrating profound impacts across diverse domains such as computer graphics, art, and medical imaging. Historically, the landscape of generative models was significantly shaped by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and auto-regressive Transformers, which exhibited considerable capabilities in content creation. However, a notable paradigm shift has occurred, with diffusion models rapidly superseding these earlier approaches. This transition is primarily driven by the impressive generative prowess of diffusion models, characterized by their enhanced controllability, capacity for photorealistic generation, and remarkable diversity in output.

This advancement is evident not only in image generation and editing but also increasingly in the complex realm of video-related research. The explicit statement that diffusion models are *rapidly supplanting* GANs and auto-regressive Transformers as the *predominant approach* for image and video generation signifies a fundamental change in the core generative paradigm. This is not merely an incremental improvement; it underscores the qualitative advantages that have driven this shift, such as strong controllability, photorealistic generation, and impressive diversity.

This indicates that the future trajectory of research and practical applications in AI-generated content (AIGC) will be heavily reliant on diffusion models. A comprehensive understanding of their underlying principles is therefore paramount for researchers and practitioners in the field, as it suggests that the inherent limitations of earlier generative models, such as GANs' propensity for mode collapse or Transformers' sequential generation constraints, are being effectively mitigated by diffusion models.

### 1.2 Overview of Diffusion Models: A New Paradigm in Generative AI
Diffusion models represent a distinct class of probabilistic generative models designed to learn the inverse of a process that systematically degrades the structure of training data. They have rapidly established themselves as the state-of-the-art in deep generative modeling, achieving remarkable success across a spectrum of challenging tasks, including high-fidelity image generation, super-resolution, and intricate image editing. Their efficacy stems from their capacity to model complex data distributions by learning a sequence of iterative denoising steps, effectively transforming random noise back into coherent and realistic data samples.

Diffusion models are characterized by their ability to learn to reverse a process that gradually degrades the training data structure. This implies a strategic decomposition of a highly complex generative task—creating novel data from pure noise—into a series of many simpler, iterative denoising steps. Each step is tasked with learning to remove only a small, incremental amount of noise. This approach renders the overall learning problem significantly more tractable compared to attempting a direct, single-step mapping from random noise to a complex, structured image.

This inherent decoupled and iterative nature of diffusion models is a primary contributor to their remarkable stability and the high quality of their outputs. By not attempting to learn the entire data distribution in one go, the models can achieve superior performance. Furthermore, this characteristic inherently supports the generation of diverse samples: by initiating the reverse process from different random noise inputs and following the learned denoising trajectory, a wide array of distinct yet valid data points can be synthesized.

2. Fundamental Principles of Diffusion Models
2.1. The Forward Diffusion Process: Gradual Noise Addition
The forward diffusion process, often referred to as the noising process, constitutes a predefined Markov chain. Its function is to gradually introduce a small, controlled amount of Gaussian noise to an original data sample, denoted as x_0, over a series of T discrete timesteps. At each timestep t, the noisy image x_t is sampled from a normal distribution whose mean is dependent on the previous noisy image x_{t-1}, and whose variance is determined by a carefully chosen, predefined schedule of constants, \beta_t. The ultimate objective of this process is to progressively transform the initial, clean image into pure, standard Gaussian noise, represented as \mathcal{N}(0, I), by the final timestep T.
The transition kernel for the forward process is defined as: q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I). Crucially, x_t can be directly sampled from x_0 at any timestep t using the re-parameterization trick, which is vital for training efficiency: x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, where \alpha_t = 1-\beta_t, \bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_i, and \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I).
The forward process is not merely a random addition of noise; it is a controlled and predefined process governed by a specific schedule (\beta_t) and adhering to a Markovian property. This means that noise is introduced incrementally and in a predictable manner. The re-parameterization trick is particularly significant as it allows for direct sampling of x_t from x_0 at any given timestep. This is crucial for efficient training because it obviates the need to simulate the entire forward diffusion chain for each training sample. Instead, one can directly sample x_0, a random timestep t, and noise \epsilon, and then compute x_t. This controlled degradation ensures that the reverse process has a clear, well-defined target at each step—namely, predicting the precise noise that was added. The fixed and deterministic nature of the forward process significantly simplifies the training of the reverse model, as it only needs to learn one direction of transformation, making the optimization problem more tractable.
2.2. The Reverse Denoising Process: Learning to Reconstruct Data from Noise
The reverse denoising process constitutes the generative component of a diffusion model. It initiates from a state of pure random noise, x_T, and iteratively removes this noise to progressively reconstruct the original data distribution, x_0. This reconstruction is accomplished by training a deep neural network, typically a U-Net, to accurately predict the noise component (\epsilon) that was introduced at each step of the forward process. Once this noise is predicted, the model can then estimate either the less noisy previous state (x_{t-1}) or, ultimately, the original, clean data (x_0).
The reverse transition kernel is parameterized as p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_{\theta}(x_t, t), \Sigma_{\theta}(x_t, t)), where the mean \mu_{\theta} and variance \Sigma_{\theta} are learned by the neural network. In many DDPM implementations, the network is trained to predict the noise \epsilon or the original data x_0 from x_t. These predictions are then used to derive \mu_{\theta}. For instance, in the DDIM formulation, the predicted original data \hat{x}_{0} is given by \hat{x}_{0}=\frac{x_{t}-\sqrt{1-\overline{\alpha}_{t}}\epsilon_{\theta}^{(t)}(x_{t})}{\sqrt{\overline{\alpha}_{t}}}, and the next denoised state \overline{x_{t-1}} is derived as \overline{x_{t-1}}=\sqrt{\overline{\alpha}_{t-1}}\cdot\hat{x}_{0}+\sqrt{1-\overline{\alpha}_{t-1}\cdot\epsilon_{\theta}^{(t)}(x_{t})}.
The reverse process is more than just a generic noise removal; it is fundamentally about learning a "trajectory back to the data manifold". This implies that the model is not simply undoing random corruption but is actively learning the intrinsic structure and relationships that define the real data distribution. The concept of "vectors" in DDPM refers to these multi-dimensional data representations (images, noise, latent states) that are transformed at each step. The iterative nature of denoising allows the model to progressively refine its predictions, moving from a highly noisy, unstructured state to a coherent, realistic image step by step. The integration of time embeddings further enhances this process by providing the model with awareness of its current stage in the denoising trajectory, akin to a "GPS for the model". This iterative refinement and the model's ability to learn and navigate the data manifold are central to the exceptional quality and photorealism observed in diffusion model outputs. It suggests that the model acquires a rich, continuous understanding of the data distribution, which enables smooth interpolations between data points and the generation of highly diverse yet authentic samples.
2.3. The Role of Random Noise in Image Generation
Random noise is a cornerstone of diffusion models, serving a dual purpose: it acts as the initial seed for the generative process and functions as a critical component in the model's training. In the forward process, controlled, small amounts of Gaussian noise are incrementally introduced to the data, gradually corrupting it until it is transformed into pure noise. This meticulously controlled noising process generates the diverse training data required for the reverse model, which then learns to predict and effectively remove this specific noise. For image generation, the process commences by sampling pure random Gaussian noise, which represents the initial state of maximal entropy. The trained denoising model then iteratively transforms this random noise into a coherent image by progressively subtracting the predicted noise over numerous steps. To further enhance the diversity of generated outputs, stochasticity can be deliberately introduced during the sampling phase of the reverse process by adding a small amount of new noise at each denoising step.
Random noise in diffusion models is far more than a mere input; it serves as the fundamental seed from which all generated images originate. Crucially, the type of noise (Gaussian) and its controlled, incremental addition during the forward process provide a consistent and well-behaved signal for the model to learn from. The model's primary objective is to accurately predict this specific noise, thereby effectively learning the inverse mapping from noisy data to cleaner data. This dual role of noise—acting as both the generative starting point and a precise training target—constitutes a core strength of diffusion models. It enables the generation of high-quality, diverse outputs from a simple random input, circumventing the complex challenges of latent space design often encountered in earlier generative models like GANs.
3. Mathematical Formulations of Diffusion Models
Diffusion models encompass several predominant formulations, each offering a distinct mathematical perspective on the underlying generative process. These include Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs), and Stochastic Differential Equations (Score SDEs). While they share the core principle of iterative denoising, their specific mathematical objectives and mechanisms for leveraging random noise differ.
Model Type
Forward Diffusion Process
Backward Denoising Process
How it Leverages Random Noise
DDPM
x_t=\sqrt{1-\beta_t}\cdot x_{t-1}+\sqrt{\beta_t}\cdot z_t, z_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)
x_{t-1}=\mu_{\theta}(x_t,t)+\sqrt{\beta_t}\cdot z_t, z_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)
Noise is added incrementally via \beta_t in the forward process, and the model learns to predict and subtract this noise in the reverse process to reconstruct data.
SGM
dx=f(x,t)dt+g(t)dw (general form for Score SDE)
Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD)
Perturbs data with various noise levels and estimates score functions. Samples are generated by chaining score functions at decreasing noise levels.
Score SDE
dx=f(x,t)dt+g(t)dw
dx=[f(x,t)-g(t)^2\nabla_x\log q_t(x)]dt+g(t)d\overline{w}
Generalizes noise scales to infinity, modeling diffusion as an SDE. Samples are obtained by reversing this SDE, starting from pure noise.

3.1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
DDPMs define the forward process as a Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise to data, transforming it into pure noise x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I). The transition kernel for this forward process is given by q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I), where \beta_t is a predefined variance schedule. The mathematical objective of the reverse process is to learn the transition kernels p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t) that reverse this noising process, effectively converting noise back into data. This is achieved by parameterizing the mean \mu_{\theta}(x_t,t) and variance \Sigma_{\theta}(x_t,t) with deep neural networks, typically a U-Net, which are trained to predict the noise added at each step. New data is generated by sampling x_T from a standard Gaussian distribution and iteratively applying the learned reverse transitions until x_0 is obtained. The core idea is to train the reverse Markov chain to match the actual time reversal of the forward Markov chain.
3.2. Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs)
Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) perturb data using various levels of noise and simultaneously estimate the scores corresponding to all noise levels by training a single conditional score network. Given a data distribution q(x_0) and a sequence of noise levels \sigma_1 < \sigma_2 <... < \sigma_T, SGMs perturb a data point x_0 to x_t using the Gaussian noise distribution q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; x_0, \sigma_t^2 I). A deep neural network, known as a Noise-Conditional Score Network (NCSN), is trained to estimate the score function \nabla_x \log q(x_t) using techniques like score matching. Samples are generated by chaining these estimated score functions at decreasing noise levels using score-based sampling approaches, such as Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD). This approach decouples training and sampling processes.
3.3. Stochastic Differential Equations (Score SDEs)
Stochastic Differential Equations (Score SDEs) generalize the concept of perturbing data with multiple noise scales to an infinite number of noise scales, providing a continuous-time framework for diffusion models. The diffusion process in Score SDEs is modeled as the solution to a stochastic differential equation: dx = f(x,t)dt + g(t)dw, where f(x,t) and g(t) are drift and diffusion functions, and w is a standard Wiener process. The mathematical objective is to reverse this process. Once the score of each marginal distribution, \nabla_x \log p_t(x), is known for all t, the reverse diffusion process can be derived and simulated. This reverse-time SDE, expressed as dx=[f(x,t)-g(t)^2\nabla_x\log q_t(x)]dt+g(t)d\overline{w}, where \overline{w} is a standard Wiener process when time flows backwards, is then simulated to obtain samples from the original data distribution p_0, starting from samples of x(T) \sim p_T.
4. Architectural Components and Techniques for Video Generation
Adapting diffusion models from static image generation to dynamic video generation presents unique challenges, primarily in maintaining temporal consistency and modeling complex motion dynamics. Researchers have developed a suite of architectural components and techniques to address these complexities, extending the generative capabilities of diffusion models to the temporal domain.
4.1. Extending U-Net Architectures for Spatiotemporal Data
The foundational U-Net architecture, widely successful in image diffusion models, has been extended to handle the additional temporal dimension inherent in video data. Early pioneering work, such as VDM, generalized the conventional image diffusion U-Net to a 3D U-Net structure. This architectural shift allows the model to process and generate video data, which inherently possesses a temporal dimension in addition to spatial dimensions.
Further advancements involve the integration of spatiotemporal convolutions and temporal attention layers. Models like ModelScope incorporate spatial-temporal convolution and attention directly into the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for Text-to-Video (T2V) tasks. This involves using convolutional layers that operate across both spatial (height and width) and temporal (time) dimensions, enabling the model to learn features that capture both appearance and motion. Temporal attention layers, as seen in Video LDM, are added to spatial layers to model relationships between different frames over time, which is crucial for ensuring video consistency and coherence. These modifications allow diffusion models to capture the intricate dynamics and inter-frame dependencies necessary for realistic video synthesis.
4.2. Latent Space Operations with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
To manage the high dimensionality and computational demands of video data, many video diffusion models leverage Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or similar autoencoders for latent space operations. This approach involves compressing high-resolution pixel data into a lower-dimensional, more manageable latent representation. For instance, Magic Video was one of the earliest works to employ Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) for T2V generation in latent space, significantly reducing computational complexity and accelerating processing speed.
The process typically involves training an autoencoder to map pixels into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by applying a diffusion denoising generative model in this compressed space to synthesize videos. This strategy reduces both training and inference costs while maintaining satisfactory generation quality. Hunyuan Video, for example, trains a 3D VAE from scratch to compress pixel-space videos and images into a compact latent space, allowing for training videos at their original resolution and frame rate. This VAE uses Causal Conv3D to handle both modalities and incorporates various loss functions (L_1 reconstruction, KL, perceptual, and GAN adversarial losses) to enhance reconstruction quality. The use of VAEs also supports hierarchical frameworks for latent space modeling, as demonstrated by LVDM, which allows for more efficient and effective representation of video data in a compressed form. This compression is vital for handling the massive data volumes associated with video.
4.3. Temporal Modeling Techniques for Coherence and Dynamics
Achieving temporal consistency and realistic motion dynamics is paramount for high-quality video generation. Various techniques have been developed to enhance temporal modeling within diffusion frameworks:
Frame-wise Lightweight Adaptors and Cross-Attention: Magic Video introduces a frame-wise lightweight adaptor to align image and video distributions, enabling directed attention to model temporal relationships effectively. Similarly, VideoFactory utilizes a swapped cross-attention mechanism to improve interaction between temporal and spatial modules, enhancing temporal relationship modeling.
Channel Shifting and Temporal Adapters: Latent-Shift employs lightweight temporal modeling by shifting channels between adjacent frames in convolution blocks, drawing inspiration from Temporal Shift Modules (TSM). SimDA incorporates a lightweight spatial adapter for visual information transfer and a temporal adapter to model temporal relationships in lower feature dimensions, further using latent shift attention to maintain video consistency.
Motion Modules and Content/Motion Separation: AnimateDiff adds a motion module to a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model to learn motion dynamics, enabling personalized video generation. DSDN introduces a dual-stream diffusion model, separating video content and motion, to maintain strong alignment and generate continuous videos with fewer flickers. CMD also proposes a video diffusion model that separates content and motion, using an autoencoder to encode videos into content frames and motion latents, and then a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to generate motion vectors.
Noise Prior Decomposition: VideoFusion decomposes the diffusion process using a shared base noise for each frame and residual noise along the temporal axis, ensuring consistency in frame motion generation. PYoCo devises a video noise prior that samples correlated noise for different frames, addressing suboptimal outcomes from directly extending image noise priors to video.
Flow-based Temporal Upsampling: VideoGen employs an efficient cascaded latent diffusion module with flow-based temporal upsampling steps to enhance temporal resolution.
These diverse approaches underscore the complexity of temporal modeling and the continuous innovation in developing mechanisms that ensure smooth, coherent, and dynamic video outputs from diffusion models.
4.4. Cascaded and Multi-stage Architectures
To achieve high-definition and high-fidelity video generation, many diffusion models employ cascaded or multi-stage architectures. This involves breaking down the complex task of generating high-resolution, long videos into a series of simpler, sequential generation and super-resolution steps.
Imagen Video exemplifies this approach, utilizing a cascade of video diffusion models. It consists of seven sub-models: one for base video generation, three for spatial super-resolution (SSR), and three for temporal super-resolution (TSR). This pipeline progressively increases spatial and temporal resolution, starting from a low-resolution base video and sequentially upsampling it to high definition (e.g., 1280x768 pixels at 24 frames per second). Each model in the cascade can be trained independently, allowing for parallelization and efficient scaling.
A critical technique for accelerating sampling in these multi-stage models is progressive distillation. This method distills a trained deterministic DDIM sampler into a new diffusion model that requires significantly fewer sampling steps without substantial loss in perceptual quality. Imagen Video employs a two-stage distillation process: first, a single diffusion model is trained to match the combined output of conditional and unconditional models, and then progressive distillation is applied to this model to reduce sampling steps. This allows the entire cascade to be distilled down to a minimal number of steps (e.g., 8 sampling steps per model), resulting in significantly faster inference times (e.g., 18 times faster in Imagen Video). This efficiency is crucial for practical applications of high-resolution video generation, as it addresses the computational intensity inherent in diffusion models.
4.5. Transformer-based and Mamba-based Architectures
The success of Transformer architectures in natural language processing and image generation has led to their widespread adoption and adaptation in video diffusion models. Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are increasingly explored for video generation tasks, leveraging their ability to model long-range dependencies effectively. Models like W.A.L.T utilize a causal encoder to compress images and videos into a unified space for joint training, adopting a window attention architecture tailored for joint spatial and spatio-temporal generative modeling. CMD also uses the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to generate motion vectors after separating content and motion. Some approaches, such as Snap Video, even replace the traditional U-Net architecture with a transformer architecture entirely, scaling up to billions of parameters to achieve competitive results in high-resolution video generation.
Beyond Transformers, newer architectures like Mamba are also being investigated for their potential in video diffusion models. Matten proposes a video diffusion model architecture that combines Mamba and Attention, exploring various spatio-temporal modeling variants. DiM further explores a pure Mamba structure for image and video diffusion models, demonstrating its scalability and ability to generate high-quality videos at a lower computational cost. These architectural innovations aim to improve efficiency, scalability, and the overall quality of generated videos by leveraging advanced sequence modeling capabilities.
5. Video Generation from Reference Images (Image-to-Video)
Image-to-Video (I2V) generation is a specialized application of diffusion models where a video sequence is generated based on a single reference image, often guided by a text prompt. This approach is particularly valuable for maintaining visual fidelity to a specific subject or style across frames.
5.1. Image-Conditioned T2V Methods
Image-conditioned Text-to-Video (T2V) methods leverage a reference image to guide the video generation process, aiming to mitigate issues such as flickers and artifacts commonly found in purely text-to-video outputs. This guidance helps in improving visual fidelity and reducing inconsistencies by injecting image control conditions into the T2V generation process.
Several implementations demonstrate this principle:
DSDN (Dual-Stream Diffusion Model): This model introduces a dual-stream architecture, dedicating one stream to video content and the other to motion. This decomposition helps maintain strong alignment between content and motion, resulting in continuous videos with reduced flickering.
VideoGen: This approach first uses a T2I model to generate a reference image from a text prompt. This image then serves as a guide for the subsequent video generation, which employs a cascaded latent diffusion module with flow-based temporal upsampling to enhance temporal resolution.
MicroCinema, PixelDance, and EMU-VIDEO: These methods inject image control conditions through an additional appearance-conditioned network or conditioned latent concatenation. The core idea is that by utilizing a reference image, these models can improve visual fidelity and reduce artifacts, allowing the model to focus more effectively on learning video dynamics.
SVD (Stable Video Diffusion): This model validates the data scaling capability of video diffusion models by collecting and labeling large video-text datasets. It releases an image2video model that has been widely adopted in subsequent research.
These methods demonstrate how incorporating a reference image provides a strong visual anchor, allowing the diffusion model to concentrate on synthesizing coherent motion and dynamic elements while preserving the visual attributes of the initial frame.
5.2. Specific Implementations: Make-A-Video and Hunyuan Video
Leading research in I2V generation showcases distinct strategies for leveraging diffusion models.
5.2.1. Make-A-Video
Make-A-Video proposes an approach that directly translates the progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation to Text-to-Video (T2V) without requiring paired text-video data. Its core intuition is to learn visual and multimodal representations from paired text-image data and learn motion dynamics from unsupervised video footage. This method accelerates T2V model training by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained T2I network.
Architecturally, Make-A-Video extends spatial layers to include temporal information using function-preserving transformations. It decomposes temporal U-Net and attention tensors, approximating them in space and time. A spatial-temporal pipeline is designed to generate high-resolution and high-frame-rate videos, incorporating a video decoder, an interpolation model, and two super-resolution models. Specifically, it uses Pseudo-3D convolutional layers (stacking 1D convolutions after 2D convolutions) and Pseudo-3D attention layers (stacking temporal attention after spatial attention) to integrate temporal dimensions efficiently. The temporal layers are initialized as identity functions, allowing a seamless transition from spatial-only training to spatiotemporal learning while retaining previously learned spatial knowledge. For image animation, Make-A-Video's masked frame interpolation and extrapolation network can be conditioned on an input image and its CLIP image embedding to extrapolate the rest of the video, enabling personalized video generation from a single image.
5.2.2. Hunyuan Video
Hunyuan Video extends its text-to-video (T2V) model to perform image-to-video (I2V) generation, where a video is generated from a single reference image and a caption. This process involves several key steps and architectural modifications.
To ensure the model accurately reconstructs the original image information, a token replacement technique is employed. The latent representation of the reference image is directly used as the first frame's latent, and its corresponding timestep is set to 0. The processing of subsequent frame latents remains consistent with the T2V training methodology. Furthermore, to enhance the model's understanding of the input image's semantics and to better integrate information from both the image and the caption, the I2V model incorporates a semantic image injection module. This module first inputs the image into a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to obtain a semantic image token. These tokens are then concatenated with the video latent token for full-attention calculation.
The I2V model is pre-trained on the same dataset as the T2V model. For specialized tasks like portrait I2V generation, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning on a curated dataset of portrait videos. This fine-tuning uses a progressive strategy where model parameters of respective layers are gradually unfrozen, allowing high performance in the portrait domain without significantly compromising generalization ability. The model also supports video interpolation by using the first and last frames as conditions, and text conditions are randomly dropped during training to enhance performance.
6. Advanced Strategies for Long Video Generation
Generating long, coherent videos with diffusion models presents significant challenges, primarily due to computational costs and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency over extended durations.
6.1. Challenges in Long Video Generation
Current video generation models typically produce short videos, often under 10 seconds. Extending video length using autoregressive methods often leads to error accumulation, causing quality degradation in later frames and a loss of coherence. The high computational cost associated with training and inference for T2V models, often requiring hundreds of GPUs due to the magnitude of datasets and temporal complexity, further compounds this challenge. Multi-stage coarse-to-fine methods, while effective, can also be complex and time-consuming to implement and optimize. These factors necessitate innovative strategies for generating extended video sequences that maintain high quality and temporal consistency.
6.2. Multi-Expert Frameworks (ConFiner and ConFiner-Long)
To address the complexities of long video generation, particularly the issues of quality, speed, and temporal coherence across extended durations, multi-expert frameworks have been proposed. The ConFiner framework, for instance, decouples the intricate task of video generation into more manageable subtasks, each handled by a specialized "diffusion model expert". This contrasts with traditional approaches that rely on a single model to perform the entire complex task.
ConFiner identifies three primary subtasks:
Modeling the video structure: Designing the overall visual structure and plot.
Generating spatial details: Ensuring clarity and aesthetic quality for each frame.
Producing temporal details: Maintaining consistency and coherence between frames for natural transitions.
The framework operates in two main stages:
Control Stage: A video diffusion model acts as a "control expert" to generate a coarse-grained video structure. This initial output, though potentially low-quality due to reduced inference steps for efficiency, serves as a foundation for subsequent refinement.
Refinement Stage: Here, a "spatial expert" (a T2I model) and a "temporal expert" (a T2V model) collaboratively refine spatial and temporal details. A key innovation in this stage is coordinated denoising. This mechanism enables experts with different noise schedulers to collaborate timestep-wise. It involves a multi-step process where the output of one expert is transformed to align with the scheduler of the other, allowing for synergistic refinement of spatio-temporal details. This multi-expert approach reduces the burden on individual models, enhancing both generation quality and speed without incurring additional training costs, as it utilizes ready-made diffusion experts.
Building on ConFiner, the ConFiner-Long framework is specifically designed for generating long, coherent videos by stitching together multiple short video segments. To ensure seamless transitions and consistency across these segments, it employs three strategies:
Segments Consistency Initialization Strategy: To ensure consistency in the initial noise across segments, a base noise is sampled and then frame-wise shuffled to derive the initial noise for each segment. This maintains a degree of randomness while promoting overall consistency.
Staggered Refinement Strategy: This strategy addresses flickering at segment junctions by staggering the control and refinement stages. The latter half of a preceding video structure and the former half of a succeeding video structure are processed together in a single refinement pass, enabling smoother transitions.
Consistency Guidance Strategy: During the sampling process, the gradient of the L2 loss (calculated between the predicted noise of the current segment and the noise in the previous segment) is used to guide the sampling direction. This guided noise helps maintain content consistency across segments.
Experimental results indicate that ConFiner can surpass the performance of models like Lavie and Modelscope T2V with significantly fewer sampling steps and lower inference costs. ConFiner-Long, leveraging these strategies, can generate high-quality, coherent videos up to 600 frames long.
7. Conclusions
The landscape of generative AI has undergone a significant transformation, with diffusion models emerging as the dominant paradigm for high-fidelity image and video synthesis. This shift is attributable to their inherent advantages in controllability, photorealism, and diversity, which surpass the capabilities of earlier generative adversarial networks and auto-regressive Transformers.
At their core, diffusion models operate on the principle of iterative denoising. A predefined forward process gradually introduces Gaussian noise to data, transforming it into pure noise. The generative power lies in the learned reverse process, where a neural network, typically a U-Net, is trained to iteratively remove this noise, effectively reconstructing the original data distribution. This decoupled learning approach, where complex generation is broken into a series of simpler denoising steps, contributes significantly to the stability and high quality of outputs. Random noise serves a dual role as both the initial seed for generation and a precise training target, enabling diverse and high-quality outputs from simple random inputs.
The mathematical foundations of diffusion models are articulated through formulations such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs), and Stochastic Differential Equations (Score SDEs). Each formulation provides a rigorous framework for modeling the forward noising and reverse denoising processes, with variations in how noise is parameterized and how the generative path is traversed.
Extending these models to video generation necessitates specialized architectural components and techniques to address the challenges of temporal consistency and motion dynamics. This includes the evolution from 2D to 3D U-Nets, the integration of spatiotemporal convolutions and temporal attention layers, and the crucial role of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for efficient latent space operations. Advanced temporal modeling techniques, such as frame-wise adaptors, motion modules, and noise prior decomposition, are continuously being developed to ensure coherent and dynamic video outputs. Furthermore, cascaded and multi-stage architectures, exemplified by Imagen Video, enable the generation of high-definition videos through sequential super-resolution steps, with progressive distillation offering significant acceleration in sampling times. The adoption of Transformer-based and emerging Mamba-based architectures further enhances efficiency and scalability.
The ability to generate videos from a single reference image (Image-to-Video generation) represents a powerful application, allowing for precise visual control. Methods like Make-A-Video and Hunyuan Video demonstrate how pre-trained image models can be adapted and fine-tuned to produce dynamic sequences while maintaining visual fidelity to a source image. Finally, the pursuit of long video generation has led to multi-expert frameworks such as ConFiner and ConFiner-Long, which decouple the generation task into specialized subtasks and employ sophisticated strategies like coordinated denoising and staggered refinement to ensure temporal coherence over extended durations.
In summary, diffusion models have fundamentally reshaped generative AI, providing robust and versatile tools for creating complex visual content. Continued research focuses on scaling these models, enhancing their temporal understanding, and improving their efficiency to meet the demands of real-world applications in filmmaking, animation, and beyond.
